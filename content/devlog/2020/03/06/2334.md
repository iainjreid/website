Today was pretty tough, I choose to go with [Haskell][1], and oh my, was it a steep
learning curve.

A few years ago I read a great introductory book on Haskell (that I couldn't
recommend more) called "Learn You a Haskel for Great Good". At the time I felt
as though I was getting a grasp on the syntax and language structure in general,
but I failed to put those learnings into practice, and between then and now, it
looks as though I'd managed to forget _everything_.
