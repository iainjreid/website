The first week is complete! I chose to go with Groovy today, not a language that
I often use (outside of Jenkins of course), but the language shares a lot of
semantic similarities with JavaScript, so it sits well under my fingers.

I went for a semi-functional approach, not something Groovy is normally used
for, but seeing that I'd not normally be allowed to write "functional" Groovy, I
thought I'd go ahead a treat myself.

You can checkout the implementation [on GitHub][1]
