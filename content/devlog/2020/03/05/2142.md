Another smooth run today, one more implementation down! Today's implementation
is written in Ruby, and it's a looker.

I feel that Ruby is a bit laborious to write, what with all of its `end`
statements, but aside from that it's a pleasure to use. It feels very much like
Python, and shares a some great syntax bonuses such as `and`/`or`; and ranges
are another hugely useful feature that my go to language JavaScript doesn't
have, so they're _always_ welcome.
