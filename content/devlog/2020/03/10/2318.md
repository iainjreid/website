Today's implementation of Conway's Game of Life is written using [Rust][1]. I like
Rust, a lot, I like the idea of it, I love the tooling behind it, and for a
modern competetor to C/C++, it's hit the nail on the head in my opinion.

I've read mixed reviews about Rust from diehard C programmers, they sometimes
ring little alarm bells in my head, but you've got to take these with a pinch of
salt.

People shouldn't brush over the fact that the ongoing development of Rust is
pushing forward not one, but two fronts, with system level programing and WASM
benefitting from the efforts of the team behind it.
