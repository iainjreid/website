A much more productive session today. I used Python for this implementation, and
although the finished product isn't nearly as elegant as a more experienced
Pythonista would produce, I can definitely see why so many people love to work
with the language!

I rarely use Python myself, so this turned out to be a nice little challenge.

You can checkout the implementation [on GitHub][1]
