I have to start by saying that this was one of the best implementations so far.
[Racket][2] is a pleasure to write! I have a soft spot for languages that look good
on the screen, and Racket looks great.

I've not used any fancy macros or features from the many extensions of Racket
(or are they different schemes entirely?), so I like to think that this is a
relatively vanilla approach. I'd appreciate feedback if anybody has any!

Before I sign off, I came across [this wonderful website][1] full of tips and
tricks on how to write tip-top Racket.
