Another day, another implementation. I decided to Go with Go today (best pun I
could think up, sorry) as per a suggestion from someone on Twitter. I'm not
hugely happy with the look of the code at the moment, but I'm glad that it's
working for now!

I'd never realised just how much Go looks like JavaScript, I'm not sure if this
was a conscious design choice or not? I'm not complaining, I love good'ol
JavaScript, any similarities are welcome from my perspective.

I will say this, although Go isn't a functional language, I'm pretty surprised
that it lacks basic instance methods for iterating over arrays, aside from
for/while loops of course. I'm not sure if I've missed something from the
documentation perhaps?
