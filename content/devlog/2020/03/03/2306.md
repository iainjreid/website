title: A Game of a Hundred Lives â€” Day 1

After a lot of procrastinating with [Blink][1], another side to this project, I
finally moved on and decided to implement the first iteration of Conway's Game
of Life in JavaScript.

It didn't take long, which was a relief seeing that I'd already frittered away a
large part of the day!
