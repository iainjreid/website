title: Removing left-pad one PR at a time

This is something that's been irking me for a while now, why is left-pad still
getting millions of weekly downloads? And why is the download count on the
rise?

Don't get me wrong, it was a hugely useful package when it was released. It
performed a specific task in a reliable fashion, stuck to the KISS principles
beautifully, and, for a few years, it quietly exploded in popularity.

That was of course until the fiasco that a lot of us will remember, when the
maintainer [pulled left-pad from NPM][1] along with 272 other packages that
they were maintaining, temporarily flooring a huge portion of the JavaScript
ecosystem in one swift movement.

Given the slightly tainted reputation of left-pad, and that [a native
alternative][2] has been available since [mid 2017][3], I think it's time we
put aside a few minutes or so to remove the package from our projects wherever
possible.

I've started doing this myself, on a casual basis, for packages I come across
that happen to still depend on left-pad. After all, the fewer packages a
consumer has to download, the better!
